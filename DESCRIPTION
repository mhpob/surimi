Description: Surimi takes as input data files representing acoustic telemetry, which
  may have column names and structures specific to particular institutions. It can
  convert, with minimal code on the user's part, data from one format to another, 
  allowing data from one institution to be easily used across software packages
  that may expect different formats.
